# ProteoViz
A visualization workflow for complexomics data.

The workflow pipeline uses the MaxQuant output - 'Protein groups' as a staring point. It lets you quickly filter and trim the output sheet and start visualizing it.

This lets you plot abundance profiles of all proteins of interest or even an entire complex. It also lets you plot heatmaps of all proteins of interest or an entire complex. The multiple ID system lets you plot graphs with alternate identifier labels, and the Log transform cell lets you transform your data via the most used Logarithms.

Sample data (cited below) is made available in the Input folder.
